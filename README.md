# SJHockeyStats-Jupyter
Completed on May 2023 for my capstone project. Developed using Jupyter Notebook.

Developed using Jupyter Notebooks with Python. It involved performing data cleaning on raw data obtained from CapFriendly and Rotowire to ensure high data accuracy and reliability. Through visualizations, player data can be analyzed, and a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) was utilized to predict player performance. This enables informed decisions on player asset management, improving decision-making and maximizing team potential.

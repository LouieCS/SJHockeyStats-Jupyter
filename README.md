# SJHockeyStats-Jupyter
Completed on May 2023 for my capstone project. Developed using Jupyter Notebook.

Developed using Jupyter Notebooks with Python. The objective of this project was to develop an application that analyzes player statistics and salaries to make predictions on future player performance, facilitating informed player asset management decision-making. The application incorporates descriptive and non-descriptive methods, including visualizations and the random forest tree algorithm.

Visualizations, such as heatmaps, display the correlation matrix between player performance metrics (goals, assists, points, shots on goal) and salary, providing an overview of their relationships. This helps identify significant predictors for subsequent analysis.

The application utilizes the random forest tree algorithm to predict player performance. By training the algorithm on historical data, it can generate predictions for goals and assists based on a given number of games played, aiding decision-making in player asset management.

Bar charts and scatter plots are used to compare player performance in goals, assists, and points. They enable easy comparisons within the team and provide insights into cost-effectiveness and contribution relative to salary.

The integration of visualizations, descriptive analysis, and the random forest tree algorithm makes the application a comprehensive tool for evaluating player performance and making data-driven decisions in building a competitive hockey team.
